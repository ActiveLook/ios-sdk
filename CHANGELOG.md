## Version 4.2.3

### Fixes
- Loosing connection with the glasses during a version check will not block auto-reconnect anymore (testedÂ only on checks, no updates)

- Mirrors Android's management of FlowControl status updates
- Flow control internal management
- Fix cancel connection on disconnected glasses

### Changes
- Add reboot delay as parameters
- Retry update on every connection

---

## Version 4.2.2

### New features
- Allows cancelling connection using `glasses` object
- New `serializedGlasses` object allowing reconnecting without scanning
